# Screwdriver Shelf
## Overview
Created to organize and centralize screwdrivers in the APIL workspace. It is made using 3D printed parts uniquely designed around each individual screwdriver. The shelf is able to comfortably hold 19 screwdrivers.

## Assembly

1. Using the M4 25mm screws, attach the 4 long legs (MLE; MLD) to the flat bottom of the 2 large panels (MPE; MPD), 1 leg on each rounded corner. Be sure to position the 2 legs with the extruding triangular supports (MLE) towards each other across the long side of the shelf. Depending on preference, the arms on the panels can be either in the front, or the back of the shelf. The side that the supports are on will be the front of the shelf.  
2. Match the 4 holes on the planar, rectangular connector (MC) with the holes on the bottom of the 2 large panels (MPE; MPD), and attach them with the M4 14mm screws.   
3. Fit the dovetail design of the 2 slim connectors (SCE; SCD) together. With the 2 closely located holes facing up towards the large panels (MPE; MPD), place it so it sits, bridging the gap between the 2 triangular supports. Matching its holes with the holes on the legs (MLE), attach them using the M4 40mm screws.  
4. Take the small panel (SP) and with the phillips head emblem facing up, position its extruding ends with holes on the slim connector (SCE; SCD). Attach it using 2 M4 20mm screws.   
5. Place the 2 small legs (SL) in line with the holes on the 2 corners of the small panel (SP), and connect them using 2 M4 20mm screws.
